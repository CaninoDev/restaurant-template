name: Allagash Curieux
description: First brewed back in 2004, Curieux was our first foray into barrel
  aging. To make Curieux, we take our Tripel and let it age in bourbon barrels
  for seven weeks. Once that time is up, we take the beer out of our cold
  cellars and blend it back with a portion of fresh Tripel. The resulting rich,
  golden ale features smooth notes of coconut, vanilla, and a hint of bourbon.
price: 22
type: beer
